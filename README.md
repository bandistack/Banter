Banter is free, open, and made for the community. 

Anyone can use it, and the best part: the community can contribute, improve it, and make it grow. 

I want Banter to be a space for everyone, where technology is built collaboratively. We already have a first version running, and this is just the beginning. Join us, try the app, and help us make it even better. Banter is for everyone — and with you, it will be much greater.
